  "data": "Stars Forever is the thirteenth studio album by Scottish musician Momus, released by Le Grand Magistery in 1999. The album represents part of Momus's \"analog-baroque\" phase.[1] Momus wrote thirty songs for Stars Forever, each about a person or group who commissioned a song for the price of $1,000. The funds raised went towards costs incurred from a lawsuit against Momus by Wendy Carlos.[3] Patrons included fellow musicians The Minus 5, Keigo Oyamada, artist Jeff Koons, retail store Other Music, and record label Minty Fresh. The album also features eight winners of a karaoke parody contest in which participants were invited to submit recordings of themselves singing over  instrumentals included on Momus' previous album, The Little Red Songbook (1998).[4] All tracks are written by Momus",
