  "title": "List of memoirs of political prisoners",
  "data": "A memoir is an autobiographical writing normally dealing with a particular subject from the author's life. The following is a list of writers who have described their experiences of being political prisoners.  Those included in the list are individuals who were imprisoned for activities ranging from peaceful dissent to violent revolutionary activity.  Some were citizens of the countries whose regimes imprisoned them and others were foreign nationals. What connects them is that they have written about their experience of having been imprisoned because of their political opposition or political identity. Note, too, that the list omits many autobiographies which deal, only in part, with a period of political imprisonment; and includes some in which imprisonment forms a major part of the book.",
