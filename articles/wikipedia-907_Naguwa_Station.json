It is operated by the Nishikigawa Railway, a third-sector railway company. The station is served by the Nishikigawa Seiryū Line and is located 20.8 km from the start of the line at Kawanishi.[1] Japanese National Railways (JNR) opened the station on 1 November 1960 as an intermediate station during the construction of the then Gannichi Line (岩日線, Gannichi-sen) from Kawanishi to Kawayama. With the privatization of JNR on 1 April 1987, control of the station passed to JR West which then ceded control to Nishikigawa Railway on 25 July 1987.[2][3] In fiscal 2011, the station was used by an average of 95 passengers daily.[1] This Yamaguchi Prefecture railroad station-related article is a stub.
