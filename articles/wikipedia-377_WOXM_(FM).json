WOXM signed on May 27, 2010. In April 2014, the WOXM call sign moved to 89.1 FM;[2] the 90.1 FM license then changed its call letters to WVXM[3] and went silent.[2] By October 2015, VPR had discovered that the new WOXM was interfering with the Vermont Electric Power Company's emergency response radio system; on October 12, 2015, VPR Classical was moved back to the 90.1 facility.[4] The station changed its call sign back to WOXM on June 28, 2019.[3] This article about a radio station in Vermont is a stub.
