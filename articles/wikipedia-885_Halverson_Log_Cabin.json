  "data": "The Halverson Log Cabin is located on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.[1] It is a one-story 16 by 20.5 feet (4.9 m × 6.2 m) log cabin which was built in 1846 by Norwegian immigrant Gullik Halverson, who came to Wisconsin in 1845 when 23 years old.  He came with his parents from Valebo, Norway.[2] It is built of apparently hand-hewn logs, with dovetailed corners.[2] It was moved to its current location in 1907.[2] This article about a property in Wisconsin on the National Register of Historic Places is a stub.
