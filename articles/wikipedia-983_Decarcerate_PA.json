  "data": "Decarcerate PA is a grassroots, all-volunteer coalition that was established to challenge mass incarceration in Pennsylvania. Decarcerate PA is a democratic organization which operates using a committee structure, with each committee dedicated to separate tasks.[1] Its platform (No New Prisons, Decarceration, Community Reinvestment) has received the support of roughly one hundred other organizations.[2] Since 2011, the coalition has been involved challenging the construction of two new prisons outside of Philadelphia in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, at the site of State Correctional Institution - Graterford.[3] In 2013, Decarcerate PA organized a 113-mile march from Philadelphia to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the state capital, to protest a decision by Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett and the Pennsylvania Legislature to increase prison funding and decrease funding in public education and social services.[4]",
