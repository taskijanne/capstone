  "data": "Maleza Baja is a rural barrio in the municipality of Aguadilla, Puerto Rico. Its population in 2010 was 1,887.[3][4][5] Maleza Baja was in Spain's gazetteers[6] until Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became an unincorporated territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Maleza Baja barrio was 905.[7] Barrios (which are, in contemporary times, roughly comparable to  minor civil divisions)[13] in turn are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanización to reparto to barriada to residencial, among others.[14][15][16][17][18] The following sectors are in Maleza Baja barrio:[19] Base Ramey, \nSector Las Villas, \nSector Martinica, \nSector Vista Ramey, \nUrbanización Base Ramey, and Urbanización Las Villas Light House.
