  "data": "Baader is a 2002 German film directed by Christopher Roth. It is a biopic about revolutionary Andreas Baader of the notorious Red Army Faction (\"the Baader-Meinhof Gang\") which operated mainly in West Germany during the 1970s.[1] The leading roles are played by Frank Giering (Andreas Baader) and Laura Tonke (Gudrun Ennslin). Birge Schade portrays Ulrike Meinhof.[2] Though the script is inspired by real-life persons and events, the storyline of the film continuously mixes fact and fiction.[3] The soundtrack was released in 2002 on Normal Records with bands like Can, Suicide, Stone Roses, Trans Am and Campag Velocet.[4] Rather than historical realism, Baader provides quotation as a means to convey its portrait of the terrorists. Instead of naturalistic dialogue, the characters often intone excerpts from interviews, articles, speeches, prison notes, or other sources from the historical record. One example is a scene late in the film. Whiele shooting rounds, Meinhof turns and calmly says, „When the time is ripe for the revolution, it will be too late to prepare it.“ 2002: Silver Bear Jury Prize of Berlin International Film Festival in the category Neue Perspektiven der Filmkunst (English New perspectives of cinematography), Christopher Roth This article related to a German film of the 2000s is a stub.
