The title was contested over an eight-round series with three races per round.[3] Championship points were awarded on a 20-16-14-12-10-8-6-4-2-1 basis to the top ten classified finishers in each race. An additional point was awarded to the driver gaining pole position for each round.[1] Note: The 1600cc Ford “Duratec” engine as used in the Ford Fiesta was introduced for the 2006 championship, replacing the Ford “Kent” engine that had been mandatory for Formula Ford in Australia for over 30 years.[7]",
