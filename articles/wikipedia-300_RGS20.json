RGS proteins are GTPase-activating proteins for Gi (see GNAI1; MIM 139310) and Gq (see GNAQ; MIM 600998) class G-alpha proteins. They accelerate transit through the cycle of GTP binding and hydrolysis and thereby accelerate signaling kinetics and termination.[supplied by OMIM][7] In melanocytic cells RGS20 gene expression may be regulated by MITF.[8] RGS20 has been shown to interact with GNAO1[9] and GNAZ.[5][10] This article on a gene on human chromosome 8 is a stub.
