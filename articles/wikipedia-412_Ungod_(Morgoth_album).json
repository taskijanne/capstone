  "data": "Ungod is the fourth and final[6][7] studio album by German death metal band, Morgoth. It was released on 26 March 2015 by Century Media, nearly two decades after their previous album Feel Sorry for the Fanatic. The band started working on the album in June 2014.[8] After releasing a two-track in August, the band went on tour with Bolt Thrower in September and October.[9] In November and December, the band continued working on the album, with Disbelief founding vocalist Karsten \"Jagger\" Jäger replacing longtime member Marc Grewe.[10] This marks the only Morgoth album with Jäger, Mind Ashes bassist Sotirios Kelekidis, and ex-Destruction drummer Marc Reign in the lineup.[11] In January 2015, the band announced the title and release date of the album, Ungod. The cover art was made by Seth Siro Anton, frontman of Septicflesh and album cover artist for bands like Paradise Lost, Soilwork, and Moonspell.[12] The band promoted the album with several singles/music videos and a short tour with Deserted Fear.[13] This 2010s metal album–related article is a stub.
