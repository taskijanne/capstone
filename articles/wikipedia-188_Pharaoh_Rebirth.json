Pharaoh Rebirth is a metroidvania game starring a bunny named Dr. Jonathan Banfield, set in Egypt.[1] Krobon says he was inspired by Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, and wished to make a game that appealed to him.[2] Pharaoh Rebirth is a 2D action exploration game, using pixel art.[3] Jonathan is a rabbit who attacks with his ears in a stabbing motion.[4] Holding down the attack button makes him spin his ears, to intercept projectiles.[4] Attacking while jumping makes him spin and attack in all directions.[4] The game was released in May 2015 for the NicoNico Game Magazine, a service which distributes independent games.[5] The game was released as freeware, and several are released each month.[6] The game was released as Pharaoh Rebirth+ on the video game distribution service Steam on March 17, 2016 and published by Degica.[7][1] Pharaoh Rebirth+ adds Boss Rush, and a hard mode.[3] Destructoid gave it an 8 out of 10.[8]",
