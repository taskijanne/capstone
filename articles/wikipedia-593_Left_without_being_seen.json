  "data": "Left Without Being Seen (LWBS) is a healthcare term often used by emergency departments (ED) to designate a patient encounter that ended with the patient leaving the healthcare setting before the patient could be seen by a certified physician.  Often the inclusion of this phrase in a medical record is the result of ED overcrowding (i.e. the patient could no longer wait in the ED to be seen by a physician, so they left without alerting a healthcare professional).  Typically, those patients who leave an emergency department without being seen are not at an increased risk of death, and often do not require inpatient hospital admission.[1][2] An increase in LWBS patients may be reflective of systemic public healthcare logistical issues.
