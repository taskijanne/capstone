The introduction of the semi-rimmed .280 Ross in 1906 caused considerable interest amongst sportsmen and gunmakers.  Gunmakers Charles Lancaster introduced the rimmed .280 Flanged Nitro Express later by in the same year for use in single shot and double rifles.  The .280 Flanged Nitro Express is very similar to the .280 Ross, although loaded to slightly lower velocities.[1] Like the .280 Ross, the popularity of the .280 Flanged Nitro Express waned after a number of hunters were killed by the dangerous game they were attempting to hunt with the cartridge.[1] The .280 Flanged Nitro Express was said to have been a favourite of King George V.[2] This ammunition-related article is a stub.
