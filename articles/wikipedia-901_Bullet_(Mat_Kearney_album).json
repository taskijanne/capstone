  "data": "Bullet is the independent debut full-length album by Mat Kearney. Recording took place at Bridge Street Studios and Dark Horse Recording in Nashville by Kearney's producer and friend Robert Marvin.[2] Bullet contains new compositions of four songs from Kearney's 2003 hip-hop EP West In November; \"Bullet\", \"Girl America\", \"Poor Boy\", and \"Tomorrow\" were significantly restructured and reworked for this release. \"Bullet\" and \"Girl America\" received further subtle remixing for inclusion on Kearney's 2006 major label debut, Nothing Left to Lose, along with then-new song \"In the Middle\". Songs \"Undeniable\", \"Renaissance\", and \"Won't Back Down\" appear on the subsequent 2006 album without any modifications from their initial release on Bullet in 2004. The album was released on compact disc via Inpop Records, and digitally by EMI Publishing Group. Two covers with the same photograph of Kearney exist, each with different fonts, colors, and title placement.[2] [Credits adapted from lyric booklet] This 2000s pop albumâ€“related article is a stub.
