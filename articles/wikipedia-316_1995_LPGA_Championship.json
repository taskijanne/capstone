Kelly Robbins won her only major title, one stroke ahead of defending champion Laura Davies.[2][3] Robbins had led after each of the first two rounds,[4][5] but fell a stroke behind leader Davies after 54 holes.[1] In a cool rain on Sunday, Robbins birdied three of the final seven holes to pass Davies for the win.[3] This was the second of eleven consecutive LPGA Championships at DuPont Country Club. It was the richest major on tour from 1990 through this year, passed by the U.S. Women's Open in 1996.
