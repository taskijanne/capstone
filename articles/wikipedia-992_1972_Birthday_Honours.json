  "data": "The 1972 Queen's Birthday Honours were appointments to orders and decorations of the Commonwealth realms to reward and highlight citizens' good works, on the occasion of the official birthday of Queen Elizabeth II. They were announced in supplements to the London Gazette of 23 May 1972 for the United Kingdom,[1] Australia,[2] New Zealand,[3] Mauritius,[4] Fiji,[5] and Barbados.[6] At this time honours for Australians were awarded both in the United Kingdom honours on the advice of the premiers of Australian states, and also in a separate Australia honours list.[2] The recipients of honours are displayed here as they were styled before their new honour, and arranged by honour, with classes (Knight, Knight Grand Cross, etc.) and then divisions (Military, Civil, etc.) as appropriate. At this time the two lowest classes of the Royal Victorian Order were \"Member (fourth class)\" and \"Member (fifth class)\", both with post-nominal letters MVO. \"Member (fourth class)\" was renamed \"Lieutenant\" (LVO) from the 1985 New Year Honours onwards. † Not issued † Not issued † Not issued † Not issued",
