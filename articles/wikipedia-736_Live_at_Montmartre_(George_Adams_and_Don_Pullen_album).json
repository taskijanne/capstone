  "data": "Live at Montmartre is a live album by the George Adams-Don Pullen Quartet with guitarist John Scofield recorded in 1985 for the Dutch Timeless label.[1] The Allmusic review by Don Snowden awarded the album 3 stars stating \"Live at Montmarte isn't all it could have been, but sometimes things just don't happen. It sounds like Scofield and the group never found a truly comfortable common ground. They don't clash, but it never feels like they're totally in synch, either, at least not enough to reach the greater-than-the-sum-of-the-quartet-with-guest-soloist-parts level\".[2] The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded the album 3 stars stating \"Scofield's unison statement with George on \"Forever Lovers\" is one of the highlights... As a live document, it's OK, but still not a proper monument to Adams's larger-than-life personality\".[3] All compositions by Don Pullen except where noted.",
