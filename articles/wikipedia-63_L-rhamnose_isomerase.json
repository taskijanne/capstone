  "data": "In enzymology, a L-rhamnose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.14) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-rhamnose, and one product, L-rhamnulose. This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting aldoses and ketoses.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-rhamnose aldose-ketose-isomerase. Other names in common use include rhamnose isomerase, and L-rhamnose ketol-isomerase.  This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism. As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes 1D8W, 1DE5, 1DE6, 2HCV, 2I56, and 2I57.
