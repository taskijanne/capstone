  "data": "The men's 50 metre pistol shooting event at the 2015 Pan American Games was held on July 17 at the Pan Am Shooting Centre in Innisfil.[1] The event consisted of two rounds: a qualifier and a final. In the qualifier, each shooter fired 60 shots with a pistol at a distance of 50 metres. Scores for each shot were in increments of 1 point, with a maximum score of 10 per shot. The top 8 shooters from the qualifying round advanced to the final. In the final, they fired an additional 10 shots. These shots were scored in increments of 0.1, with a maximum score of 10.9 per shot. The total score from all 70 shots was used to determine the final ranking. The winners of all fifteen events, along with the runner-up in the men's air rifle, skeet, trap and both women's rifle events, qualified for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, provided the athlete has not yet secured a quota for their country.[2] All times are Central Standard Time (UTC-6).",
