  "data": "NGC 986 is a barred spiral galaxy in the southern constellation of Fornax, located about 76 million light-years away.[4][5] It was discovered on August 5, 1826, by the Scottish astronomer James Dunlop, who described it as a \"faint nebula, of an irregular round figure\". The galaxy has an angular size of 3′.8 × 1′.9 with a visual magnitude of 10.9. It belongs to the Fornax Cluster of galaxies.[6] This galaxy has a nearby companion, NGC 986A, at an angular separation of 17′, corresponding to a projected separation of 110 kpc. The two appear unconnected.[5] The morphological class of NGC 986 is (R′1)SB(rs)b,[4] indicating this is a barred spiral (SB) with an outer pseudo-ring (R′1), an incomplete inner ring (rs), and moderately wound spiral arms (b). The galactic plane is inclined at an angle of 37° to the line of sight from the Earth. The resulting ellipsoidal profile has its major axis aligned along a position angle of 127°.[4] The nucleus of NGC 986 is undergoing intense star formation[5] and there is an H II region at the core. The large central bar extends ~14 kpc and is rich in dense gas.[4] The galaxy contains two large, extended and slightly warped arms that begin at each end of the central bar, forming an S-shape. There may be a tidally-disrupted dwarf galaxy at the end of its northern arm.[5] One supernova has been observed in NGC 986: SN 2018lei (type Ic, mag. 16.8).[7]",
