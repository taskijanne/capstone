It is a remake of the Kannada film Victory (2013).[1] At the time of release, the film proved to be the highest-grossing film for Allari Naresh.[2] Sakshi Chaudhary was cast opposite Allari Naresh for the second time after James Bond (2015).[4] Newcomer Kanwa Ranawat was signed to play one of the lead actresses.[5] The soundtrack was composed by Sai Karthik. Sify wrote that \"Despite no proper script, Selfie Raja offers some laughs in the first half, but the movie meanders into a mess post interval. Except for few scattered laughs and spoofs, the second half is bore\".[6] The Times of India gave the film a rating of two-and-a-half out of five stars and noted that \"Cut to 2016, four years after the release of one of his best films, Sudigadu (2012). Naresh is still making films. But sadly, he hasn't been able to deliver anything with punch and yet again, Selfie Raja just adds to that dull streak of his career\".[7] The Hindu stated that \"Selfie Raja by Eshwar Reddy looks like a movie made in a hurry, inspired by a selfie concept\".[8] The film made 1.3 crores in the Nizam region.[2]",
