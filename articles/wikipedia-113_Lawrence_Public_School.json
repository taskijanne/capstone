Ths historic structure was named after Captain James Lawrence, whose last words, \"Don't give up the ship!\", gained famed during the War of 1812.[3] The school was damaged by a fire in 1912, but was able to be repaired. Reportedly, a crowd of school children danced and cheered as the building burned and its 200-pound (91Â kg) bell fell from its supports.[4] It closed in 1939, along with the nearby Bayard School and Foster School, when all students were transferred to the new elementary wing of Arsenal Junior High School.[5] The building was sold in 1945 and then used as a warehouse.[6] The school was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.[1] The two upper floors were destroyed by a fire in 1987[7] and the building was truncated at the ground floor. Since 2017, it has housed a brewery, Eleventh Hour Brewing.[8]",
