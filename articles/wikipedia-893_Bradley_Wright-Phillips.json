He began his career with Manchester City in the Premier League, before spending the remainder of his time in England with Southampton, Plymouth Argyle, Charlton Athletic and Brentford. Wright-Phillips joined the New York Red Bulls halfway through the 2013 season, helping them to the Supporters' Shield, and in his first full season he equalled the league's record for most goals in a single campaign with 27.

Internationally, Wright-Phillips earned five England U20 caps in 2005 and, after moving to North America, rejected the opportunity to represent Jamaica through his family background. Wright-Phillips is the son of former Arsenal and England player Ian Wright. His half-brother, Shaun Wright-Phillips,[3][4] was his teammate at the New York Red Bulls for two seasons. He grew up in Brockley, South London and attended the state school Kelsey Park School in Beckenham and then moved to Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham College nearby in New Cross Gate.
