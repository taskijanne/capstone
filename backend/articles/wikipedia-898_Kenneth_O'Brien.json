O' Brien and Rose Mary Crimmins.[1] He attended Yale University and later Fordham University Law School.[2] In 1932, he served as the chairman of Herbert Lehman's gubernatorial campaign.[3] He also served as the treasurer of the Democratic National Committee.[2] He became a Justice of the New York Supreme Court in 1934, appointed by Governor Lehman to replace Justice Curtis A. Peters.[4] During his 1934 gubernatorial campaign, Robert Moses accused Lehman of appointing O'Brien to the Court as a reward for political favors O'Brien's law firm had performed, arguing that O'Brien's appointment was not the result of \"knowledge and experience but influence\".[5] He married Katherine Mackay, daughter of Clarence H. Mackay, in 1922.[6] Before the ceremony, the couple received the papal benediction from Pope Piux XI.[7] Katherine was granted a divorce in 1937, on the grounds of mental cruelty.[8] O'Brien served as the model for a minor character in John O'Hara's novel BUtterfield 8.[9]",
