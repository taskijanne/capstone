  "data": "Al Zahra Hospital, Sharjah, is a private general hospital in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Al Zahra serves some 400,000 outpatients and 23,000 inpatients annually,[1] with a capacity of 137 beds.[2] Facilities at the hospital include a 9-bed Intensive Care Unit and a 14-bed long term care and rehabilitation unit as well as seven operating theatres and a number of specialised units.[3] Established in 1981, the hospital was one of the first and largest such facilities in the UAE. The building was originally intended to be a hotel and construction started in March 1975 but was re-purposed in 1978, with Mumbai-based architects Karani and Sanghoi Associates instructed by the building's owner to redevelop it into a hospital. The adjacent Concord Cinema was developed at the same time.[4] The hospital was acquired in March 2017[5] by Abu Dhabi-based NMC Healthcare for $560 million from previous owner Gulf Medical Projects Company,[1] which continues to own and operate Al Zahra Hospital, Dubai.[6] Al Zahra Hospital, Sharjah, recorded 2015 revenues of $130.4 million, with a net income of $38.8 million. The hospital employs some 1,250 staff, including 170 doctors. It also offers facilities to visiting doctors.[7] In May 2018, the hospital signed an MoU with the Sharjah Health Authority to offer 30% discounts to elderly Emirati citizens.[8] It also opened a cosmetic surgery facility that month, under the NMC-owned CosmeSurge brand.[9]",
