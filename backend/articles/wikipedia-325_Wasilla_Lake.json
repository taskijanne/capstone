  "data": "Wasilla Lake is a lake in Wasilla, Alaska, named by workers constructing the Alaska Railroad after a nearby creek named Wasilla Creek.[1] The lake shore is the site of a city park, Newcomb Park.[3] It is the northern terminus of the Seven-Mile Canoe Trail, the other end being at Finger Lake.[4] Outside of the park areas, most of the shoreline is private property. The lake has a stable population of rainbow trout and fishing is considered good for bank, boat, and ice fishing.[5]",
