  "data": "Courage of the West is a 1937 American western film directed by Joseph H. Lewis in which Bob Baker made his debut as a singing cowboy. During the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln establishes the \"Free Rangers\" to protect gold shipments from the west. A ranger adopts the son of a convicted outlaw. He grows up and becomes the head of the Rangers. He finds himself in pursuit of a gang of gold robbers, not knowing that their leader is his natural father. After various twists and turns, the father is shot and the hero marries the girl with whom he has fallen in love.[1] The film was the first production that Joseph H. Lewis directed.[2]\n75 non-union cowboys were hired in Sonora to work on the movie. Lewis was told that the Screen Actors Guild did not have jurisdiction at this distance from Los Angeles, although its members would have to be paid the standard rates agreed with the Guild.[3]\nFilming was completed in seven days.[4]\nThis movie, Baker's first, was thought to be his best. The others suffered from predictable plots and poor scripts.[5]\nLois January, the love interest in the film, said, \"Bob Baker was too pretty! He was nice, but didn't get friendly. He didn't want me to sing a song in his picture. That business is full of jealousy...\".[6] The railroad scenes were filmed on the Sierra Railroad in Tuolumne County, California.[7] Baker sings Resting Beside the Campfire, Ride Along Free Rangers, Song of the Trail, and I'll Build a Ranch House on the Range.\nFleming Allen wrote all these songs.[8] A New York Times review said, \"Nothing of cult director Joseph H. Lewis' much-vaunted flair is on display in this average musical Western\".[8] Citations Sources",
