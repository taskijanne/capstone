  "data": "The Madonna del Ceppo is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Filippo Lippi, commissioned to him between 1452 and 1453. It is housed in the Civic Museum of Prato, Italy[1] (though exposed in the local Museum of Wall Painting, in the Palazzo degli Alberti). The name derives from the fact that it was located over a pit of the garden of Pia Casa dei Ceppi in Palazzo Datini, in Prato. In the centre, the Madonna and Child are flanked by Saints Stephen and John the Baptist; below, Francesco Datini presents to the Virgin the four Buonomini (\"Honourable Men\") of the Ceppo: Andrea di Giovanni Bertelli, Filippo Manassei, Pietro Pugliesi and Jacopo degli Obizzi.
