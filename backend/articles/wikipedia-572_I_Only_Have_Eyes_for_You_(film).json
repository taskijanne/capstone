  "data": "I Only Have Eyes for You is a 1937 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Tex Avery.[4] The short was released on February 27, 1937.[5] The title of this short is based on the song of the same name. The short's copyright was renewed in 1964.[a] The protagonist (voiced by spoonerism specialist Joe Twerp), who drives an ice-delivery truck, is wooed by a homely spinster bird (voiced by Elvia Allman) who hopes to entice him with her culinary talents. The iceman, on the other hand, is only interested in Katie Canary (a Katharine Hepburn impression voiced by Sara Berner),[6] who only wants to marry a radio crooner and rebuffs his overtures to the point where she prefers ordering a refrigerator. The iceman, in order to win Katie, hires a voice imitator, Professor Mockingbird (voiced by Tedd Pierce), to simulate crooners from the back of his ice truck while the iceman lip-syncs. The scheme eventually backfires when Professor Mockingbird turns blue from the extreme cold in the ice truck, and gets sick to the point that he sneezes the top of the truck off, causing Katie to discover the iceman's ruse. Katie marries the Professor, being sufficiently impressed by his crooning ability (while replacing her radio with an electric refrigerator, as a means to keep the iceman away from her forever), while the iceman is finally won over by the spinster's cooking and baking and presumably marries her.
