In 1997, Internet Crna Gora (ICG) was founded, the first Montenegrin Internet provider, which operated within Telekom Montenegro.[citation needed] In 2005, Telekom was acquired by Magyar Telekom, becoming a part of Deutsche Telekom Group. In 2006, the T-Com and T-Mobile brands were launched. In May 2009, Crnogorski Telekom a.d., T-Mobile Crna Gora d.o.o. and Internet Crna Gora d.o.o. were merged into one legal entity, Crnogorski Telekom a.d. In 2012, the T-Com and T-Mobile brands were replaced by the T brand, under which all products are now marketed. In January 2017, Hrvatski Telekom bought the complete Magyar Telekom's stake in Crnogorski Telekom A.D.
