  "data": "The Finlay Limestone is a geologic formation in western Texas, southern New Mexico, and northern Chihuahua. It preserves fossils dating back to the early Cretaceous period.[1][2] The formation is composed of massive gray limestone with a few thin beds of brown sandstone, with a total thickness of 130–426 feet (40–130 m).[1][2] It is exposed in the Finlay Mountains (31°22′N 105°36′W﻿ / ﻿31.36°N 105.60°W﻿ / 31.36; -105.60),[1] the Sierra de Juarez,[3] and the Cerro de Cristo Rey uplift (31°47′13″N 106°32′46″W﻿ / ﻿31.787°N 106.546°W﻿ / 31.787; -106.546).[2] The formation overlies the Cox Sandstone[1] and is overlain by the Del Norte Formation.[2] The formation is highly fossiliferous, containing fossils characteristic of early Cretaceous Albian and Comanchean age.[2] The formation includes carbonate replacement deposits of lead, zinc, and silver in northern Mexico, along the Chihuahua CRD belt.[4] The formation was first defined by G.B. Richardson in 1904 and assigned to the Fredericksburg Group.[1]",
