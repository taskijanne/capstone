  "data": "The Eguiturii or Eguituri were a Ligurian tribe dwelling in the Alpes Maritimae during the Iron Age. They are mentioned as Eguituri by Pliny (1st c. AD).[1] The meaning of the ethnonym Eguituri(i) remains unclear. The original nominative form was probably Eguiturii.[2] The prefix egui- may be a variant of equi-, which can be translated as 'horse', with an archaic preservation of labio-velar -kʷ- (in contrast to Gaul. epos).[3] The suffix -turi(i) may be compared with the ethnic name Turi or Turii (Tyrii), a tribe living nearby in upper Stura valley.[2] The Eguiturii probably dwelled in the upper Verdon valley.[2] Their territory was located east of the Adanates, Gallitae and Bodiontici, west of the Nemeturii, north of the Sentii and Vergunni, and south of the Savincates and Caturiges.[4] They are mentioned by Pliny the Elder as one of the Alpine tribes conquered by Rome in 16–15 BC, and whose name was engraved on the Tropaeum Alpium.[1]",
