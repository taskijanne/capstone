The series was created and executive produced by Michael Jacobs and Ehrich Van Lowe.[1] Its final episode aired on November 20, 1993. The series starred Doug E. Doug as Douglas St. Martin, a Trinidadian American teenager living in the Harlem section of New York City. He lived with his caring, hard-working parents and his younger sister. Much of the show focused on Douglas's misadventures with his best friends, Reggie (Flex) and Malcolm (Shaun Baker). The show was based on Doug E. Doug's own childhood. A midseason replacement, the series drew critical acclaim for its realistic portrayals, but the show brought in low ratings compared to rest of the TGIF lineup, putting the show on the brink of cancellation. Support from fans and Bill Cosby helped the show get renewed for a second season.[2] The show returned in the summer on Tuesdays after Full House, which raised the ratings temporarily. Bill Cosby then became a consultant on the series. However, the show was moved to Saturday nights with the debuting George as its lead-in for its second season, and the ratings were even lower than before. Eight episodes were produced for the second season, but the series was cancelled after only three of them had aired. Reruns of the series, including the unaired episodes, were broadcast on the TV One cable network in 2009. In The Netherlands, the series was aired by RTL 4. T G I f",
