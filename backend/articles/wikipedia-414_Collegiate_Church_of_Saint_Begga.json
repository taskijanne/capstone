  "data": "The Collegiate Church of Saint Begga (French: Collégiale Sainte-Begge) is a collegiate church in Andenne, Belgium. Founded in the 7th century, the currently visible church dates from 1770 to 1775 and was designed by architect Laurent-Benoît Dewez. The church traces its origins to the 7th century, when an abbey was founded in Andenne by Saint Begga.[1] By the 11th century, the abbey was transformed into a collegiate church, eventually developing into an aristocratic community centred around the church. Eventually, the living quarters became more monastic in character and had their churches; by the 18th century, there were seven churches and corresponding communities, surrounded by a wall.[2] The current church replaced these structures and was built 1770–1775 to designs by architect Laurent-Benoît Dewez.[3] The church is built of limestone, the floor plan consisting of a nave with two aisles, five bays long. The transept has two side chapels and ends in two apses; the choir also ends in an apse.[3] The façade is in two levels wherein, the first is decorated with Ionic pilasters and crowned by an entablature; and the second storey has Corinthian pilasters and is crowned by a pediment.[3] 50°29′13″N 05°06′13″E﻿ / ﻿50.48694°N 5.10361°E﻿ / 50.48694; 5.10361",
