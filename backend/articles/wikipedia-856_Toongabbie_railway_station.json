  "data": "Staffed: 6am to 7pm Toongabbie railway station is a heritage-listed railway station located on the Main Western line, serving the Sydney suburb of Toongabbie. It is served by Sydney Trains' T1 Western and T5 Cumberland line services. Toongabbie station opened on 26 April 1880.[3] The station was a small, unattended conditional stopping place. The first platform was on the northern side of the track.[4] When the line was duplicated in March 1886, an additional platform was added on the south side of the tracks. A disc on the end of a five-foot pole was held up by intending passengers to stop the train.[4] The “Toongabbee” station is listed on the 2nd subdivision of the Darcyville estate in 1886,[5] part of the estate of the late D'Arcy Wentworth, which stretched from Toongabbie to Westmead. The station was rebuilt in the 1940s when the Main Western line was quadrupled.[6] In 2018, work was completed on an accessibility upgrade which like its neighbouring stations Pendle Hill and Wentworthville included a new concourse, footbridge and lifts as part of the Station Accessibility Upgrade Program.[7] CDC NSW operates two bus routes via Toongabbie station, under contract to Transport for NSW: Toongabbie station is served by two NightRide routes:",
