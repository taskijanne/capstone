  "data": "Eragrostis ciliaris, the gophertail lovegrass, is a species of grass (family Poaceae).[2] It is native to the Old World Tropics; nearly all of Africa, Madagascar, other Indian Ocean islands, the Arabian Peninsula, the Indian Subcontinent, Myanmar, Vietnam, Taiwan and the Philippines and a number of Pacific islands, and has been introduced to the New World Tropics and Subtropics, from the southern United States to Argentina, the Caribbean, and other Pacific islands.[1] Its seeds are edible and nutritious, but quite small and difficult to harvest and handle, so it is usually regarded as a famine food.[3] This Chloridoideae article is a stub.
