Mikawa-Tōgō Station is served by the Iida Line, and is located 25.0 kilometers from the starting point of the line at Toyohashi Station. The station has one island platform connected to the station building by a level crossing. The station building has automated ticket machines, TOICA automated turnstiles and is unattended. The station building is modeled after a wooden palisade from the time of the Battle of Nagashino, which took place near the station. Mikawa-Tōgō Station was established on September 23, 1900 as Kawaji Station (川路駅, Kawaji-eki) on the now-defunct Toyokawa Railway (豊川鉄道, Toyokawa Tetsudō).  On August 1, 1943, the Toyokawa Railway was nationalized along with some other local lines to form the Japanese Government Railways (JGR) Iida Line, and the station was renamed to its present name.[1]  Scheduled freight operations were discontinued in 1962. The station has been unattended since 1984. Along with its division and privatization of JNR on April 1, 1987, the station came under the control and operation of the JR Tōkai.
