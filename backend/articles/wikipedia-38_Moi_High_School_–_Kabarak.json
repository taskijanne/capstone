The school was established in 1979 as a mixed boarding school by the Late President Daniel Moi, who is one of the longest-serving leaders in Kenya's history. The school was named after the nearby Kabarak Farm owned by President Moi. In the years since its founding,  Moi High School Kabarak has undergone significant changes. In the 1990s,[1] the school introduced a primary school and later, a kindergarten. The primary school has since become a feeder school to the high school. The school also introduced a new curriculum to the high school, which emphasizes holistic education.[citation needed] One of the most significant changes to the school occurred in 2002. After President Moi retired from politics, the management of the school was handed over to a board of governors.
