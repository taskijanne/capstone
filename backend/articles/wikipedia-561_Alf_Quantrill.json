Born in Rawalpindi, Punjab, British India where his father was based on military service,[4] he played on either wing and appeared four times for the England national team.[2] Quantrill played non-league football for Boston Swifts until being signed by Derby County in 1914. Quantrill helped Derby gain promotion to Division One in his first season at the club, but his career was soon interrupted by the First World War. He served as a member of the Derbyshire Yeomanry, but was sent home after developing malaria in Salonika. Quantrill returned to health and retained his place in the Derby team when league football resumed. In March 1920 he made his debut for England against Wales, a 2–1 defeat. He went on to win four caps, scoring once, in the 5–4 win at home to Scotland. In 1921 Quantrill was transferred to Preston North End, playing in a forward line also including Tommy Roberts, Rowland Woodhouse and Archie Rawlings. He made  his debut on 27 August 1921 in a 2–2 draw away to Bolton Wanderers. Quantrill played in 64 games for Preston before leaving in 1923 to join Bradford Park Avenue. He later moved to Nottingham Forest in August 1930 where he finished his league career in April 1932. Quantrill was married to Hetty Winifred Bloomer, the eldest daughter of former England international Steve Bloomer and had two children.[2][5] He served as a private in the Derbyshire Yeomanry during the First World War.[6] This biographical article related to association football in England, about a forward born in the 1890s, is a stub.
