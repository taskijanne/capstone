  "title": "1976 Mahoran Comoros referendum",
  "data": "A referendum on remaining in the Comoros was held in Mayotte on 8 February 1976.[1] The proposal was rejected by 99.42% of voters.[1] The French National Assembly passed a law on 31 December 1975 allowing for the independence of the Comoros without Mayotte. A referendum was subsequently organised in Mayotte for February 1976 to determine whether residents of the territory wished to remain part of the Comoros or stay under French control.[1] France vetoed a United Nations Security Council proposal to call off the referendum;[2]  this marked the first and so far the only time France has vetoed a United Nations Security Council Resolution on its own. Five nonaligned states had proposed that the Security Council call for the cancellation of the referendum.[2]",
