  "data": "Goin' Downtown is a point-and-click adventure game developed by Silver Style Entertainment and published by The Games Company and Kalypso Media in English.[1] It was released on May 22, 2008 for Windows. The game received mixed reviews, praising its setting and graphics, but criticizing its brevity, un-detailed story, and simplistic gameplay. The game is a traditional point-and-click adventure which lets one mouse button move the main character within the world and the other interact with items and people.[1] Most of the obstacles are inventory based puzzles, but at various times there are also dialogue puzzles and a \"faux stealth section\".[1] The main character is Jake McCorly, a rising star in the New York City police force in the late 21st century.[1] Depressed from the death of his wife, he goes out to investigate a case of disappearing prostitutes when he rescues one who later disappears under mysterious circumstances.[1] The game's publisher, The Games Company, went bankrupt before it could be localized into English.[1] The game was bought by Kalypso Media, who localized it but did not dub the game into English.[1] Adventure Gamers rated the game 3/5 stars, saying that its sci-fi setting was \"convincing\" and the graphics \"lovely\", but calling the plot development lacking and the puzzles simplistic and easy, and criticizing the lack of English voice acting.[1] GameStar rated the game 79/100, praising the setting and adult themes of the game, but calling the main character unsympathetic and certain aspects of the game illogical.[2] Igromania rated the game 7/10, calling the Russian localization poorly done.[3] == External links ==",
