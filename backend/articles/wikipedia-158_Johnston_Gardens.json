The gardens are used for weddings, both ceremonies and for photography.[citation needed] Access is from Viewfield Road close to the Gordon Highlanders Museum in the Rubislaw district of central Aberdeen. The park was formerly part of the Johnston House estate, but was gifted to the city in 1936.[1] The park contains a Japanese garden centred upon a pond and arched bridge. This section contains bamboos and acers. The paths are lined with rhododendrons and tall beech trees.[citation needed] The park contains a memorial to the men killed on helicopter flight G-REDL 85N on 1 April 2009.[citation needed] This Aberdeen location article is a stub.
