  "data": "The Octoraro Railway was an American shortline railroad that operated in Pennsylvania from 1977 to 1994. This company was formed in 1976. It obtained a lease from SEPTA to operate freight trains on the Octoraro Branch, a former Pennsylvania Railroad branch line, between Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania and the state line near Sylmar, Maryland. It also leased the Wilmington and Northern Railroad, a former Reading Company branch, from Elsmere Jct. (Wilmington, Delaware) to South Modena (Modena, Pennsylvania). The company then created a connection between the two lines at Chadds Ford. [2][3][4] The Octoraro Railway ceased operations on June 30, 1994. The Delaware Valley Railway acquired the company on July 1, 1994.[5] Delaware Valley, a subsidiary of RailAmerica, operated the line until 1999, followed by the Brandywine Valley Railroad (BVRY).[5] The Morristown and Erie Railway provided freight service from July 1, 2003, to November 18, 2004, but operated under the trade name of Octoraro Railroad.[4] East Penn Railway took over operation in 2004 and purchased the right of way from SEPTA.[6] In 2007 the company merged to become East Penn Railroad and operates the Octoraro line.",
