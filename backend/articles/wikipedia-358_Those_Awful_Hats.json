  "data": "Those Awful Hats is a 1909 American short comedy film directed by D. W. Griffith and starring Mack Sennett.  It takes place in a small, crowded movie theatre, where the patrons are perpetually distracted by people - primarily women - wearing large, ostentatious hats that obstruct everyone else's views of the screen. Slapstick disorder ensues. The film ends with a title card reading, \"Ladies Will Please Remove Their Hats.\" A print of the film survives in the film archive of the Library of Congress.[2] This 1900s short comedy film-related article is a stub.
