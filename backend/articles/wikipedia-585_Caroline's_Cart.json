  "data": "A Caroline's Cart is a specific type of shopping cart which allows for the assisted locomotion of non-ambulatory adults or larger children. The Caroline's Cart was invented by Drew Ann Long, a mother of a special needs daughter from Alabama.[1] They are named after Long's daughter, Caroline, and were first made available at American retail stores in 2011.[2] They are manufactured by Technibilt.[3] Caroline's Carts are designed to enable caretakers to push a larger disabled person while allowing room for loading the cart with groceries. Features include a forward facing seat with a five-point harness and extended handles to provide room for the person being pushed.[2] They have the capacity to hold a 250-pound occupant.[1] The carts have six wheels with brakes for stability and ease of loading.[4] The carts are utilized in stores such as Kroger,[5] Publix,[6] Save Mart,[7] Target,[8] and Walmart.[9]",
