  "data": "Avington is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Kintbury, in the West Berkshire district, in the ceremonial county of Berkshire, England. The village is on the River Kennet, just under 1 mile (1.6 km) northwest of Kintbury village and 2 miles (3 km) east of the town of Hungerford. The Kennet and Avon Canal follows the river and passes the village. In 1931 the parish had a population of 77.[1] On 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished and merged with Kintbury.[2] The toponym is derived from Old English and means \"the enclosure (tūn) of Afa's people\". The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as Avintone and a pipe roll from 1167 records it as Avintona.[3] The Church of England parish church of Saints Mark and Luke is an 11th-century Norman building. It consists of only a nave, chancel and late 19th-century north transept. The font is a notable piece of Romanesque sculpture and may be Saxon.[4] The south doorway is a Norman arch. The chancel has Norman vaulting and a Norman arch, both with \"beakhead\" ornament.[5] A few early Gothic additions to the church were made in the 13th century, including two doorways and a \"low-side\" window.[5] The church is a Grade I  listed building.[4]",
