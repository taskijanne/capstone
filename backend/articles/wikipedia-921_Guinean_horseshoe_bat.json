Its natural habitats are subtropical and tropical forests, moist savanna, caves, and other subterranean habitats. It was described by M. Eisentraut in 1960 as a new subspecies of the Lander's horseshoe bat with a trinomen of Rhinolophus landeri guineensis. The holotype was collected near Kolenté, Guinea.[2] In 1978, it was elevated to full species status.[3] It is considered \"medium-sized\" for an African horseshoe bat. Its forearm length is 44–50 mm (1.7–2.0 in) and individuals weigh 8–11 g (0.28–0.39 oz). Its dental formula is 1.1.2.32.1.3.3 for a total of 32 teeth.[4] Its range includes several countries in West Africa such as Ivory Coast, Guinea, Liberia, Senegal, and Sierra Leone.\nIt is found in high elevations greater than 1,400 m (4,600 ft) above sea level.[5] As of 2008, it is listed as an endangered species by the IUCN.",
