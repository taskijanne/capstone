  "data": "Demonbreun's Cave is a cave in Nashville which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Davidson County, Tennessee (NRHP) in 1979. The cave was named after a fur trapper named Timothy Demonbreun. There is a large crack in the facade along the Cumberland River which is named for fur trapper Timothy Demonbreun. The cave was originally a home for Demonbreun in an area of Tennessee which was home to the indigenous Chickasaw tribe. He used the cave for a short time because it was near a plethora of Game animals. The cave appears to be a crack in the rocks along the Cumberland River. It is approximately one mile upriver from Nashville on the right river bank.[1][2] The cave was listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Davidson County, Tennessee in July 1979. It was first explored between 1750 and 1799.[3] This article about a property in Davidson County, Tennessee on the National Register of Historic Places is a stub.
