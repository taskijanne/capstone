Hoshur is a political émigré from the Uighur Region of China and an opponent of the Sinicization of his homeland.[2][3] He left China in 1994 when his journalism got him \"into trouble with the authorities\" and now works for Radio Free Asia in Washington, D.C.[2] According to the New York Times, Hoshur's \"accounts of violence in his homeland are among the few reliable sources of information about incidents in a part of China that the government has sought to hide from international scrutiny\".[3] Chinese authorities accused Hoshur of instigating the July 2009 Ürümqi riots with his reporting.[2][3][4][5]  He was credited by McClatchey in October 2015 as being the sole journalist able to get accurate news out of Xinjiang Province, China.[6] China arrested one of Hoshur's brothers in 2014, sentencing him to five years in prison.[2] Two other brothers were arrested in 2015.[2] Hoshur calls the arrests and trials of his brothers \"thin excuses to justify the continued harassment of me as a journalist reporting on events in China's Uighur region\".[2] The United States Department of State has urged Chinese authorities \"to cease harassment of his family and to treat them fairly and with dignity\".[2]",
