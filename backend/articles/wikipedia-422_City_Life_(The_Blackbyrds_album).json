  "data": "City Life is the third studio album by the American R&B/jazz-funk fusion group the Blackbyrds, released in 1975 on Fantasy Records.[3] \nThis album peaked at No. 1 on the US Billboard Top Jazz LPs, No. 3 on the Top R&B Albums and No. 16 on the Top Pop LPs charts. City Life has also been certified Gold in the US by the RIAA.[4][5] City Life was produced by Donald Byrd and includes singles \"Happy Music\" and \"Rock Creek Park.\" \"Happy Music\" peaked at No. 19 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and No. 3 on the Hot R&B Songs charts. The tune also got to No. 11 on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart.\nWhat's more, Rock Creek Park peaked at No. 37 on the US Billboard Hot R&B Songs chart.[4] Stewart Mason of AllMusic proclaimed, \"The Blackbyrds -- a jazz-funk outfit formed in a university class taught by jazz trumpeter Donald Byrd, who produced the albums and wrote most of the tunes -- were more of an Earth, Wind & Fire-style horn band than a purist jazz crew, but few groups were better in their chosen style, and 1975's City Life is probably their best album...This is often-sublime stuff ripe for rediscovery by fans of '70s funk, soul, and fusion.\"[2] Song credits and timings taken from original LP.[6] The original LP doesn't credit any musicians individually and instead gives a general \"very special thanks\" to them. Vocals for the album are also uncredited.",
