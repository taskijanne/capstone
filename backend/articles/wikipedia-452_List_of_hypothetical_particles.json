  "data": "This is a list of hypothetical subatomic particles in physics. Some theories predict the existence of additional elementary bosons and fermions that are not found in the Standard Model. Supersymmetry predicts the existence of superpartners to particles in the Standard Model, none of which have been confirmed experimentally. The sfermions (spin-0) include: Another hypothetical sfermion is the saxion, superpartner of the axion. Forms a supermultiplet, together with the axino and the axion, in supersymmetric extensions of Peccei–Quinn theory. The predicted bosinos (spin 1⁄2) are Just as the photon, Z and W± bosons are superpositions of the B0, W0, W1, and W2 fields, the photino, zino, and wino± are superpositions of the bino0, wino0, wino1, and wino2. No matter if one uses the original gauginos or this superpositions as a basis, the only predicted physical particles are neutralinos and charginos as a superposition of them together with the Higgsinos. Other superpartner categories include: The following hypothetical particles have been proposed to explain dark energy: The following categories are not unique or distinct: For example, either a WIMP or a WISP is also a FIP. Hidden sector theories have also proposed forces that only interact with dark matter, like dark photons. These hypothetical particles were claimed to be found or hypothesized to explain unusual experimental results. They relate to experimental anomalies but have not been reproduced independently or might be due to experimental errors:",
