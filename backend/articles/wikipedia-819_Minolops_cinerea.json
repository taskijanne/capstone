  "data": "Minolia cinerea Preston, 1909 Minolops cinerea is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Solariellidae.[1] The height of the shell attains 6.75 mm, its diameter 6.5 mm. The shining shell has a roundly turbinate shape. It is grey, painted above with closely set transverse bands of greyish brown. The 6½ whorls are flattened above. The sculpture and the colouring is complicated and it is very difficult to give anything like an adequate description. The whorls are sculptured with a number of beaded carinae, increasing to four on the body whorl. The space above these are occupied by two spiral beaded riblets, a third also occurring between the first and second carinae. The sutures are impressed. The base of shell is sculptured with two spiral grooves and a number of very fine spiral striae. It is painted with a zone of fine, closely set cinereous flammules, within which is a second zone almost uniformly of the same colour. The umbilicus is whitish, wide, deep, and bears several small, indistinct, spiral, crenate riblets. The outer margin is surrounded by a coarsely crenulate carina. The columella is somewhat angularly arched above, descending obliquely and terminating rather abruptly. The peristome is acute. The aperture is subquadrate.[2] This marine species is endemic to Australia and occurs off Queensland.",
