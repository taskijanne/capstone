  "data": "We Like It Here is an album by American jazz fusion group Snarky Puppy that was released on February 25, 2014.[1] From the moment Snarky Puppy played its first overseas show to a sold-out London crowd, they felt at home in Europe. Recorded and filmed live with a studio audience over 4 nights in the Netherlands, We Like It Here captures the band at its most explorative point in its career, in both composition and improvisation. The film created alongside the album (included in the CD/DVD combo, and on Snarky Puppy's YouTube page) also contains over an hour of interviews, behind the scenes tour footage in Europe, and alternate solo takes from the recording sessions. [2] The track \"Lingus\" includes a solo on the synthesizer performed by Cory Henry.[3][4] All tracks are written by Michael League except where noted",
