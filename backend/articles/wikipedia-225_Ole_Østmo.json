The gold medal was in the standing shooting event, which gave him the momentum in the combination to also take a silver behind Frank Jullien of Switzerland. Additionally, the Norwegian team won a silver.[3] Three years later Ole Østmo returned to France to participate in the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris where he won four Olympic medals—two silver and two bronze.[1] The silver medals were awarded in the standing 300 metre free rifle he missed out on first place by six points to Lars Jørgen Madsen from Denmark,[4] and in the team 300 metre free rifle event, finishing behind the team from Switzerland,[5] the bronze medals came in the prone 300 metre free rifle, finishing behind Frenchman Achille Paroche and the Dane Anders Peter Nielsen,[6] and he got the other third place in the three positions 300 metre free rifle,[7] he did compete in another event the kneeling 300 metre free rifle but he could only manage fifteenth place.[8] Østmo died in Oslo in 1923 just two days before his 58th birthday.[1]",
