  "data": "The Tottori at-large district (Japanese: 鳥取県全県区, Hepburn: Tottori-ken Zenken-ku) was an electoral district represented in the House of Representatives in the National Diet of Japan. From 1947 until 1993, it elected four representatives from Tottori Prefecture. In the 1947 Japanese general election, the Japan Socialist Party was the only party to have two winning candidates for the district, while the Liberal Party and Tottori Prefectural Farmers' Union had one each.[1] For the next four elections until the 1955 Japanese general election, most of the winning candidates would come from parties that would eventually merge into the Liberal Democratic Party; the only two exceptions were Kaku Ashika [ja] and Itaru Yonehara [ja], who were elected to the district for left-wing parties.[1] Starting with the 1958 Japanese general election, the LDP would hold at least half of the district's seats for the rest of the district's existence.[1] Ashika, Bun Takebe [ja], and Koken Nosaka being the only representatives elected from the district without any affiliation with the LDP.[1] At the time the Public Offices Election Law [ja] came into law in 1950, the district encompassed the entirely of Tottori Prefecture.[2] Due to the 1994 Japanese electoral reform, the at-large district was replaced with two single-member districts starting with the 1996 Japanese general election.[3]",
