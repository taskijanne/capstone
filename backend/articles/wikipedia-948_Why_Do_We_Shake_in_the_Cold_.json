  "data": "Why Do We Shake in the Cold? is the debut studio album by British electronic musician Elderbrook. It was released on 18 September 2020 through Parlophone Records.[1] The album includes his most recent charted hit \"Something About You\" with Rudimental. Malvika Padin of The Line of Best Fit felt that the \"11-track production builds as the culmination of Elderbrook's life experiences and consistently ascending career graph\", calling it \"euphoric and sombre in equal parts\" and a \"companion on good days and bad\" with \"finely crafted music\".[3] Reviewing the album for Clash, Sidney Franklyn wrote that \"The more we delve into Why Do We Shake..., the harder it becomes to justify Kotz's insistence in writing exclusively vocal-driven dance music. Lyrics range from the bland on 'I'm a Fool' and 'All My Love' [...] to the downright bizarre\", going on to say that \"it's towards the end of the record that Kotz's potential as a producer really begins to shine\".[2] Notes",
