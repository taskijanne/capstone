It may grow up to 10 metres tall and has mottled bark. The shiny green leaves are 30 to 80 mm long and 5 to 15 mm wide, and have silvery scales underneath. Star-shaped white flowers are produced in groups of 1 to 9 in the leaf axils in spring.[2] The species was first formally described in 1988 and named Phebalium wilsonii[1]\nThe species was transferred to the genus Nematolepis by Paul G.
